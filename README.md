Personal project where I am building a website about myself to learn about Github version control, CursorAI, and just coding in general.
Funny enough after a week or so, I failed with the backend implementation using Python and accidentally made all changes to the main branch. I ended up downloading all the code from the repo, deleting the repo, and making a new one starting where I left off. In retrospect, I could have deleted the main branch and created a new one since the test and main had all the same stuff. So that was a mistake because by deleting the repo on github rather than archiving it, I lost all my commits this year (were not a ton but still cool to see progress.
That is the point of this project though, learning the basics!
